                    As in <b>nslogin-web</b>, upon which this project is based,
                    all code is run client-side and passwords are only
                    transferred to NationStates (and optionally saved in your
                    browser's local storage).
                    <br>
                    Nothing is transferred to me (or Auralia) as a third party.
                    <br>
                    You can verify this yourself by reading the source code
                    of <a
                    href="https://github.com/dithpri/goldretriever-web">goldretriever-web</a>
                    and of <a
                        href="https://github.com/auralia/node-nsapi">Auralia's node-nsapi library</a>.
                    <br>
                    Please note that passwords are not required for the same
                    functionality as provided by Valentine-Z's original script.
                    <br>
                    Passwords are only needed if you want to retrieve the number
                    of unanswered issues and/or the number of unopened packs, as
                    these are accessible only to logged-in nations.
                    <br>
                    If you do not trust the code, I highly recommend you do not
                    use the issue/pack functionality (reasonable security
                    practice) — in that case, don't even
                    input the passwords!
